# 1D-Game
A first-person game from the perspective of a 2D life form, which makes it a 1D game. Try to make it to level 5 without getting a headache!

This project has some of the most messy code that I've written in recent years, but I've already spent too much time on it.

You probably shouldn't play if you are sensitive to flashing colors, especially on the "trippy" setting.
